# The Weather Application

>  ## Why was this app made?
> You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
> Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

> ## Completed
> -   Created an account on [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/), and generate a key
> -  Got the weather data using the native JS [`fetch()`](https://devdocs.io/dom/fetch_api/using_fetch) method.
> - In the home page the user can enter the city of their choice
> - On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 1 day.
